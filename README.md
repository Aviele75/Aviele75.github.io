**Title:** [Auto Car Dealer Analysis Report](https://github.com/Aviele75/Aviele75.github.io/blob/main/CAR%20DEALER%20REPORT%20ANALYSIS.pbix)													

**Tools Used:** PowerBI, Data Transformation and Cleaning using Power Query Editor, Data Modelling, DAX writing, Dashboard Building and Visualization using charts, slicers and page navigation.

**Project Description:** 
This project involved the comprehensive analysis of an auto car dealership's sales data, aimed at uncovering key trends, patterns, and performance metrics across various dimensions of the business. The primary objective was to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard that empowers stakeholders to effectively monitor and assess the organization’s operational and financial performance.

The dashboard consolidates and visualizes critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), offering a holistic view of business outcomes across different business types, vehicle models, and company locations. Key performance metrics included:

**Total Revenue**

**Total Cost**

**Profit and Loss**

**Total Quantity Sold**

**Purchase Order Amount**

**Dashboard Features**

**Revenue by Company:** Provides a breakdown of total revenue generated by each auto dealership company, enabling comparative analysis of performance across companies and vehicle models.

**Percentage Profit and Loss by Company:**  Visually represents the profit and loss margins for each company, with particular emphasis on identifying which entities experienced the most significant financial losses.

**Purchase Order Amount by Company:** Displays a company-wise distribution of total purchase orders, providing insight into procurement trends and business volume.

**Total Cost Incurred by Company:** Illustrates the total operational costs incurred by each company, supporting a deeper understanding of cost centers and financial efficiency.

**Top 10 Salesmen by Revenue:** Ranks the top 10 sales representatives based on the revenue they generated, allowing management to evaluate individual performance and recognize high achievers.

**Total Cost by Business Type:** Breaks down the operational costs according to business type (e.g., retail, repairs, spare parts), facilitating cost-control strategies at a more granular level.

The dashboard incorporates dynamic slicers to allow stakeholders to:

**Filter by Business Type:** Analyze performance data by specific business operations (e.g., retail, repairs, spare parts).

**Drill Down by Company:** Examine the performance of individual companies within the dealership network.

**Key findings:**

**High Loss Identification:** A significant area of concern was uncovered in the form of high losses, particularly within the repair segment of the business, as opposed to the retail sector. This points to a need for operational reviews and improvement strategies in the repairs unit.

**Revenue and Cost Patterns by Record Type:** The analysis revealed that spare part sales were the largest contributors to revenue. However, they also accounted for a high proportion of total costs, suggesting a need for more strategic cost management in this segment.

**Top-Performing Payment Channel:** Cash emerged as the most profitable payment channel. In contrast, non-cash transactions were associated with the highest loss percentages, warranting a deeper evaluation of these methods and their implications on profitability.

**Sales Volatility and Market Dynamics:** Variability was observed across several factors including car brand, model, location, and service consultant. These fluctuations underscore the importance of understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics to better forecast demand and tailor business strategies.

**Conclusion:**

The sales performance dashboard developed through this project serves as a vital decision-support tool for the management team.
