By consolidating complex datasets into a user-friendly interface, the tool enables a deep dive into the factors that influence tenant retention and property performance.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

The dashboard tracks and visualizes the following core metrics:
**Tenant Churn Rate**
**Average Tenant Satisfaction Score**
**Average Occupancy Rate**
**Average Monthly Rent**
**Percentage of Rent Collected**

**Highlighted Features:**
**Churn Status and Satisfaction Score by Property Type:**
A breakdown of churn rates and satisfaction scores segmented by property type offers insights into how different property categories impact tenant sentiment and turnover.

**Lease Term Frequency Distribution:**
Visual representation of lease term durations, illustrating the distribution of tenant preferences and potential links to retention patterns.

**Satisfaction Score by Survey Responses:**
Graphical analysis of tenant feedback, highlighting satisfaction levels and key themes from survey responses.

**Renewed vs. Expired Leases**
Comparative visualization showing the proportion of leases renewed against those that expired or were terminated, providing clarity on lease retention effectiveness.

**Temporal Analyses - Monthly breakdowns of:**
Tenant churn status
Renewed versus expired leases
Average satisfaction scores
Rent collection performance

**Interactive Slicers for Dynamic Analysis:**
**Month Selector** – Enables month-by-month performance review.
**Year Selector** – Filters data across specific years for trend analysis.
**Property Type Filter** – Allows stakeholders to drill down into individual property types for focused performance evaluation.

**Key Insights & Findings:**

**Seasonal Churn Patterns:**
The monthly churn rate visualization reveals recurring seasonal trends, with certain periods showing higher tenant turnover. These patterns indicate when targeted retention strategies may be most impactful.

**Lease Term Preferences and Retention:**
Analysis of lease duration preferences shows a correlation between specific term lengths and tenant retention, suggesting the potential value in adjusting lease offerings to better align with tenant behaviour.

**Satisfaction as a Retention Driver:**
A clear relationship exists between satisfaction scores and tenant retention. Properties with higher satisfaction ratings exhibit lower churn, underlining the importance of tenant experience in retention strategies.

**Financial Operations and Efficiency:**
Rent collection data offers insight into the operational and financial health of the properties. Trends in payment consistency and collection efficiency can indicate areas for process improvement or automation.

**Renewal Strategy Effectiveness:**
Comparing renewed and expired leases over time helps gauge the success of implemented retention strategies and identifies periods where adjustments may be needed.

**Recommendations:**

**Implement Targeted Retention Initiatives:**
Use seasonal churn data to launch proactive retention programs during high-risk periods. These could include personalized outreach, loyalty incentives, or community engagement events.

**Align Lease Offerings with Tenant Preferences:**
Where data indicates a preference for certain lease lengths, consider adapting offerings to meet these preferences. Flexibility in lease terms may encourage longer stays and reduce churn.

**Focus on Enhancing Tenant Satisfaction:**
Address areas identified in tenant feedback that influence satisfaction, such as amenities, maintenance responsiveness, and community atmosphere to foster stronger tenant relationships.

**Optimize Rent Collection Processes:**
Improve financial operations by identifying and addressing inefficiencies in rent collection. Implementing digital payment platforms or incentives for timely payments could support better cash flow and tenant compliance.

**Conclusion:**
The developed dashboard serves as a vital strategic tool for the residential real estate management team and stakeholders. By consolidating critical data into an intuitive interface, it enables clear and actionable insights that support evidence-based decision-making.

Notably, the lowest satisfaction levels were recorded in February and March, whereas the highest ratings occurred in September and October. This trend suggests that while certain periods saw improvements in service delivery, there is still considerable room for enhancement. Emphasis should be placed on sustaining high performance during peak months and addressing the challenges experienced earlier in the year.

**Increase in Patient Volume:**  Data indicates a higher number of male patients compared to females. This finding underscores the need for better resource planning and the possible acquisition of advanced medical equipment to support growing demand and enhance operational readiness.

**Average Waiting Time:** The average waiting time across the year was recorded at 36 minutes, a figure that may be considered suboptimal. This relatively long wait time may be attributable to underlying systemic or logistical issues. Addressing these challenges will require adaptive strategies and targeted interventions aimed at reducing wait times and improving overall patient experience.

**Conclusion:**

This dashboard serves as a vital tool for healthcare professionals and management teams. By presenting data in an accessible and interactive format, it facilitates informed decision-making, enhances strategic planning, and supports continuous improvement efforts. Ultimately, the insights derived from this analysis are instrumental in driving patient-centered care and operational excellence within cardiology units.

**Key findings:**

**Elevated Discrimination Rates Among Male Students:**  Contrary to common assumptions, male students were identified as the most affected group in terms of reported discrimination. This insight signals the need for more inclusive and gender-sensitive mental health support systems.

**Undergraduates as the Most Affected Group:** Discrimination appears to impact undergraduate students more significantly than their postgraduate counterparts. This finding underscores the importance of introducing early mental health awareness programs and peer support initiatives at the undergraduate level.

**Influential Psychological Factors:** The study identified insecurity, anxiety, and depression as the leading psychological factors driving student discrimination. Their fluctuation over time offers valuable insight into behavioral patterns and can be leveraged to adapt emotional wellness strategies and mental health interventions accordingly.

**Conclusion:**

This project delivers a powerful, data-driven tool aimed at empowering educational institutions and student wellness bodies. By providing clear, actionable insights through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard, stakeholders are better equipped to understand the scope and impact of discrimination on student mental health. The analysis supports strategic planning and policy-making, ultimately contributing to safer, more supportive academic environments.
